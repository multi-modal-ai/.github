<h2 style="font-family: Work Sans; font-weight: 700;"> Welcome to Neural Bits</h2>

Neural Bits is not an yet another Technical Newsletter on AI that's sharing news and promotes the AI hype. **We stay practical.**

My name is Alex, I'm the founder and writer of the NeuralBits Newsletter.

Throughout my ~10 year career in Deep Learning and AI, working across Applied AI Research, Engineering and Operations I've gathered expert insights on what AI is and how to build reliable AI Systems.
