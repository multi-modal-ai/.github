<h2><span><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/regular/handshake.svg" width="30px"/></span> The Goal </h2>

[Neural Bits](https://neuralbits.substack.com) addresses the AI/ML Engineering niche and is a useful resource for you if you're looking to build and understand complex AI Systems in a step-by-step manner.
**The motivation is simple:**
```diff
1. You want to build with AI.
- 2. Hands-on resources are scarce.
3. You look for books, courses, and tutorials.
- 4. They are high-level, or pricey.
5. You'll eventually find some resources.
- 6. There's no one to explain it step by step.
+ 7. You came here
```

> [!TIP]
> I've been building AI Systems for the past ~9 years, working across AI Research, Engineering, and ML Operations on multiple Deep Learning/GenAI projects.
> My goal is to share practical insights, best practices, and guides on how to grow the right engineering mindset that'll allow you to upskill as an AI Engineer.
