<h2><span><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/6.x/svgs/regular/handshake.svg" width="30px"/></span> The Goal </h2>

[Neural Bits](https://neuralbits.substack.com) addresses the AI/ML Engineering niche and is a useful resource for you if you're looking to build and understand complex AI Systems in a step-by-step manner.
**The motivation is simple:**
```diff
1. Many want to understand and build with AI.
2. They search for resources to learn.
- 3. They find a lot of basic-level resources and flashy AI news channels.
4. They look for courses, tutorials.
- 5. They find 1000$+ bootcamps from 1-year-of-experience experts in AI.
6. They eventually find good resources.
- 7. There's no one to guide them through and help them understand.
+ 8. They find out about Neural Bits
+ Now they can follow and code along complex AI Systems under a Senior AI Engineer's guidance!
```

> [!TIP]
> I've been building AI Systems for the past ~9 years, working across AI Research, Engineering, and ML Operations on multiple Deep Learning/GenAI projects.
> My goal is to share practical insights, best practices, and guides on how to grow the right engineering mindset that'll allow you to upskill as an AI Engineer.
