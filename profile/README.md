Neural Bits is not yet another Technical Newsletter on AI that shares news and promotes the AI hype. **We stay practical.**

My name is Alex, I'm the founder and writer of the NeuralBits Newsletter.

Throughout my ~10-year career in Deep Learning and AI, working across Applied AI Research, AI Engineering, and ML/LLM Operations, I've gathered practical knowledge on building reliable AI Systems.

>[!TIP]
> My main goal is to distill and share that with aspiring AI Engineers!
